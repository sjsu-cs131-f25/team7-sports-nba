# Team 7 — NBA Basketball Analytics

### CS 131 — Processing Big Data (Fall 2025)

### Final Project — Distributed Data Engineering & Analysis

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project performs large-scale analytics on a historical **NBA dataset (1946–present)** using **PySpark**.
We designed and executed a distributed data pipeline to clean, transform, and analyze NBA team and player statistics.
Outputs include processed analytical tables, Spark UI screenshots, and the final written report.

## 🚀 How to Run the Distributed Job

Our pipeline logic lives in:
`code/main.py`

It loads input data, applies transformations, and writes results to the output folder.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.x

* PySpark

* Local Spark OR access to a distributed Spark cluster

### 2. Run Locally (Standalone Spark)

From the repository root:

```bash
spark-submit code/main.py \
--input data/input/ \
--output data/output/
```

This command:

* Loads raw data from `data/input/`

* Runs all data transformations and aggregations

* Writes the outputs into `data/output/`

### 3. Run on Any Spark Cluster

```bash
spark-submit \
--master <your-cluster-master> \
--deploy-mode client \
code/main.py \
--input <input-path> \
--output <output-path>
```

Examples:

* `gs://your-bucket/input/`

* `hdfs:///user/team7/input/`

* `s3://your-bucket/input/`

### 4. Optional: Dataproc Serverless Execution

```bash
gcloud dataproc batches submit spark \
--region=us-central1 \
--batch=team7-nba-run \
--execute code/main.py \
-- \
gs://your-bucket/input/ \
gs://your-bucket/output/
```

## 📥 Input Data Location

Local input path:
`data/input/`

Cluster / Cloud input path:
`gs://your-bucket/input/`

Contents include:

* Player statistics

* Team statistics

* Game logs

* Play-by-play datasets

## 📤 Output Data Location

Local output path:
`data/output/`

Cluster / Cloud output path:
`gs://your-bucket/output/`

Outputs include:

* Cleaned datasets

* Aggregated tables

* Player/team performance summaries

## 📈 Spark UI Evidence

A distributed Spark run includes:

* **Jobs tab** — stage and task breakdown

* **SQL tab** — physical execution plan

* **Executors tab** — resource usage metrics

Screenshots of the Spark UI are included in the final report.

## 🤖 AI Tooling Disclosure

AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used **selectively and minimally**, specifically for:

* Clarifying Spark error messages

* Understanding PySpark configuration flags

* Improving documentation clarity

All code and analytic logic were manually written, tested, and validated by the team.
